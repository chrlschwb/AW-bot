# Alien Worlds Auto Bot v.0.1

This bot automatically mines TLM and solves the captcha through the Anti-Captha service

The first working bot for the game Alien Worlds. You will never be banned. The bot always mines with a different delay, so the game thinks that you are a real person.

Download: Code => download zip

And so let's proceed with the installation.

Bot setup:

1. Download Python on 3.8 Windows x86â€“64 executable installer
2. Install it, do not forget to select the ADD TO PATH checkbox
3. Transfer the folder with the bot to the desktop for convenience, rename it to AWbot (the path to main.py should be something like this / desktop / AWbot (this is the name of the folder with the bot) /main.py
4. Go to the console (CMD) and write cd desktop / awbot Or cd desktop, cd awbot
5. pip install -r requirements.txt
6. Perhaps he will swear at the version pip, then write a command that will appear in the console
7. pip install selenium-requests
8. Install Mozilla Firefox If you already have it, check that the version is 90+
9. Install Node JS 14.17 LTS (as of 05/13/2021)
10. Go to config.py and in the CAPTCHA_KEY = 'YOUR KEY' field insert your captcha key https://anti-captcha.com/ (Works only on it) Do not touch the rest in the config, otherwise you will break everything.

Test key - c7222053aa7131e9b09ab2638bb99a15

8. Do not change anything and click on the button that is marked (export)
9. Open the notebook, paste everything from the clipboard there, do not touch anything.
10. Save it as 1.json (1.json - for the first account, 2 .json - as for the second, etc. FILE TYPE - ALL FILES, not .txt
11. For the rest of the accounts, do steps 3-10

IMPORTANT!!!! After each save the account, CLEAR history in the browser !!!!

INCLUDE BOT

We drop all * .json files into the cookies folder (if not, create them) in the bot. The numbering MUST start with 1.json and continue with 2,3,4,5 ...
Go to the console (CMD) write cd desktop / awbot
Writing python main.py
Let's start the bot
PS if I forgot to indicate something in the guide, the console will write you what else you need to install.
First, it will close all firefox.exe processes, check all the cookies that you have made, if everything goes ok to mine. Sometimes the bot dulls, you just need to restart. If you have a large pool of accounts, then I advise you to run up to 10 accounts first and look at the CPU and RAM load of your Dedicated Server.
I hope you will have time to earn at least as much as I do))
All good and cool TLM farming
